# ski 0.1.12

[ski](https://pypi.org/project/ski/) is a Python package for running reinforcement learning (RL) experiments on an inventory control problem called retailing skis (Eric V. Denardo [1982]). The problem is formulated as Markov decision process (MDP) and solved by fundamental RL algorithms including Monte Carlo (MC) method, Sarsa, Q-learning, and double Q-learning in both tabular and value approximation manner.
